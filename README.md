Wassertoff File Manager


The File Manager is a comprehensive file management application built with Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and Firebase. It offers secure user authentication, file upload capabilities, real-time file listing, and a responsive design. To set it up, clone the repository, install dependencies, and configure Firebase for authentication, Firestore, and storage. Environment variables for Firebase configuration need to be added to a .env.local file. Once configured, running the development server will start the application, providing a user-friendly interface for managing files efficiently.
